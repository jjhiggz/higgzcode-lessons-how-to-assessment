# How to Take Your Assessment

## 1. Don't Cheat

I'm going to be honest. This is a small community here. Nobody knows about this school and having a degree from "Higgzschool" doesn't mean shit. The thing that will mean shit is if you learn how to code. If you cheat your way through this program, then you will not know how to code and won't be able to get a job. You are going to need to be able to work on your own projects, solve algorithms, and interview well by the end of this. I am also very flexible with you and how you move your way through this program so just don't cheat.

## 2. Pass / Fail

These assessments are pass / fail. You have to do all of the things that I am asking you to do on it... period. If you can't do them you are not ready to move onto the subsequent material, and would be better off waiting until you are caught up and following along with the material online.

## 3. Take it as many times as you want

When you take an assessment, they aren't going to change. That means you can feel free to run through it as many times as you want until every objective feels comfortable. The goal of these is to scare you just enough into learning stuff that is OUTSIDE of your comfort zone, but what I don't want is anybody freaking out about these assessments. Remember this isn't a real school, your not going to flunk out if you are struggling on a test. Reach out for help on discord, ask questions, and participate and I am confident that you will learn this shit.

## 4. During Assessment Week

During Assessment week, you will have 30 minutes at the beginning of each class to take this assessment, I may adjust this time as time goes on. If you don't complete it then you can work on it on your own time and reach out to me for a 1:1 to see if you pass. The more you communicate the better that I can help you  ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ 

## 5. START FROM SCRATCH EVERY TIME
You should always be starting from scratch. You will be creating the file, unless otherwise specified.
